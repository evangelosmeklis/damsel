# Damsel: Your AI-Powered Code Mentor

**Damsel** is an open-source AI tool designed to help developers write better code by mimicking the guidance of a senior engineer. This project is a **fork of [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/)**, with a shift in focus to **learning** and **improvement** rather than just code assistance.

Instead of offering generic code completion, Damsel helps you:
- Master **Low-Level Design** (LLD) for interviews.
- Write clean, maintainable code based on principles from *Clean Code* and other coding standards.
- Improve your coding skills through **mentor-like feedback**.

## Key Features:
- **Code Review Assistant**: Receive feedback to improve code readability, efficiency, and maintainability, following best practices.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD) Guidance**: Interactive exercises and mock interviews to practice real-world design tasks.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Receive suggestions to refactor code based on well-known software development principles.
- **Mentorship Mode**: Learn *why* specific coding practices are important with detailed, actionable explanations.
- **Mock Interview Mode**: Practice LLD coding tasks with feedback as if in an actual interview.
